## About me 🤓 👋

In 2025, I received my PhD in Astronomy and Planetary Ciences from the Instituto de Investigacion en Astronomia y Ciencias Planetarias (INCT), Universidad de Atacama, Chile.

My PhD thesis was conducted within a duration of 3 years with an additional 1.5 years of course work. My PhD thesis is titled, "Galaxy Evolution in Massive Clusters over the
last five billion years", and a major part of the thesis covers the target selection of the probable galaxy cluster members for the ESO 4MOST CHANCES survey.

## Here is what I do

- Study Massive Galaxy Clusters (z<0.6) using Optical and Near-infrared photometry
- Catalogue Creation for the ESO 4MOST CHANCES Evolution Subsurvey (Haines et al., 2023)
- Data reduction and analysis: Multi-object spectroscopy using the IMACS f/2 instrument on the 6.5 m Magellan Baade Telescope
- TBD...
